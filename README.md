# DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGY IN FETAL HEALTH PREDICTION USING CARDIOTOCOGRAPHY DATA

In this project, our team created a machine learning model to classify the result of Cardiotocogram test to ensure the well being of the fetus. The dataset of interest is the fetal health dataset on Kaggle.

## Dataset Information
Cardiotocography (CTG) is used during pregnancy to monitor fetal well-being and allows early detection of fetal distress,  allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality.

The output variable in this dataset is the fetal heath, which consists of 3 classes: Normal, Suspect, Pathological.

## Libraries
